GNUCONIO 0.1 2012

Thanks for downloading the opensource and GPL license gnuconio-0.1 library.
With this you can use colors, getch and others graphical functions based
on the conio.h library, using the #include "conio.h" normally, in Windows
or Gnu Linux systems.

In Gnu Linux systems only copy the conio.h file to your programs folder
to use it. You will need the NCURSES library to work on linux (libncurses-dev).

In Windows you will need to compile the conio.c file, and use the conio.o file
in your compiler library list. Tested on the compiler Code::Blocks.

To start the conio use any function, except the printf and scanf. To end the
program, make the text color == background color, and use the clrscr() function.

Have Fun !
